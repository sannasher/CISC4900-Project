INCC SITE: The website serves as an online platform for our community center, providing information about our services, programs, team members, and contact details. 

This GitHub repository contains the previous source code and assets for the sample website of the INCC. The previous code is just HTML, CSS, and image files that are used to build and style some content for the site. Included here will be any files relating to the class. There will be NO NEW CODE in this repository, since I am now using React, and have created two new repos. Please see the following repos. 

Frontend: https://github.com/sannasher/incc-client
Backend: https://github.com/sannasher/incc-server
The website with react is a work in progress, with a completion goal of May 12, 2024.
