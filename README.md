OLD VERSION 
This GitHub repository contains the source code and assets for the sample website of the INCC. The website serves as an online platform for our community center, providing information about our services, programs, team members, and contact details. It currently includes HTML, CSS, and image files that are used to build and style some content for the site. There will be NO NEW CODE in this repository, since I am noww using React, and have created two new repos. Please see the following repos. 

Frontend: https://github.com/sannasher/incc-client
Backend: https://github.com/sannasher/incc-server
The website with react is a work in progress, with a completion goal of May 12, 2024.
